The criterion gives the ideal ratio of the bank roll that should be placed on a bet.  \n\nIf a single bet has a positive outcome with *objective* probability $p$ and a negative outcome with probability $q = 1-p$, then the Kelly criterion is given by\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{\\alpha_w p-\\alpha_l q}{\\alpha_w\\alpha_l},$$\nwhere $\\alpha_w$ is the multiplies of the amount of stake that is won in the case of a win and $\\alpha_l$ the amount proportional to the stake that is lost. \nMany exchanges, such as Betfair, use the decimal odds system. When backing a selection in the decimal system, the losing amount is the stake itself, so $\\alpha_l = 1$, and the winning multiplier is the quoted price $P-1$. Additionally, commisions are typically proportional to winnings, which further reduce the potential winnings.\n\nThe `kelly_back_dec` and `kelly_lay_dec` functions allow for a quick calculation of the Kelly criterion given the true probability, the quoted price and a commision percentage.\n```{r}\nlibrary(RKelly)\n\n# A bet to back at price 2.1 and objective probability of 0.5 and 5% commision\nkelly_back_dec(price = 2.1, p=0.5, commision_rate = 0.05)\n```\n\nThe same applies for lay bets where $\\alpha_w = 1$ and $\\alpha_l = P-1$.\n```{r}\n# A bet to lay at price 1.9 and objective probability of 0.5 and 5% commision\nkelly_lay_dec(price = 1.9, p = 0.5, commision_rate = 0.05)\n```\n\nA negative Kelly criterion means that the bet is not favored by the model and should be avoided.\n```{r}\nkelly_back_dec(price = 1.9, p=0.5, commision_rate = 0.0)\n```\n\nUse at your own risk.\nMore detailed derivations can be found here.
